/**
 * This is the "old way" of creating rectangles. It's less performant (up until ~40x slower with 200x200 rectangles), but it's able to create
 * actual rectangles (with 90Â° corners) for the ordinal directions. But because I assume people mostly need rectangles in the cardinal directions,
 * I've decided to drop "true ordinal rectangle" support for now.
